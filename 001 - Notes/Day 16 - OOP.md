# **Object Oriented Programming**
#### syntax
> OOP is basically a paradigm of programming where pieces of code are modularized, to make them easier to re-use.
> It basically breaks down complex code down and makes it scalable especially when doing larger and more complex projects.

### How to use OOP
 We create a blueprint (called a class). and then initialize instances of that class (called objects).
To create an new instance, assign it to a variable.
Example; timmy = Turtle() # where Turtle is the class
![[Pasted image 20251224093349.png]]
to access attributes or methods use the name of the object (.) the name of the attribute or attribute.
Example; timmy.screen() # Where screen() is a method (function) in the Turtle class

### Accessing attributes and methods
to reference an attribute use the objectname.attributename
Example:
timmy.name
To reference a method use the objectname.methodname()
Example
timmy.cook()

### Packages
Packages are essentially pre-written code that people have written for functionality.
Basically they contain multiple files that have been bundled together.
