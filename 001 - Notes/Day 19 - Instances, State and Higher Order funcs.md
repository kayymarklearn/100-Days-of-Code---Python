# **Event Listeners**
> These are functions that perform actions when a keyboard or mouse even is triggered or pressed.
> Most event listeners take functions as inputs (In this case the function are used as args without brackets).
> Example;
> ```
> screen.listen()
> screen.onkey(key="space", fun="move_forward") # where move_forward() is a function to run when the 'space' key is pressed
> ```

## Higher order functions
> Is basically a function that can take other functions as inputs.

> #Note When using a function that you have not created yourself (for example, from modules or packages); it is advised to use keyword arguments instead of positional arguments.
